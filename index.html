        <p>My family and I are originally from the Dominican Republic. A place where the weather is always warm and the people are always cheerful. We came to the US when I was a child, leaving behind everything for a brighter future. We settled in New York, where I was raised. I later moved to New Jersey.</p>
        <p>I believe everyone has a favorite memory from their childhood. For me, it was the Christmas of 1997 when my parents surprised me with my first ever computer. It was a Compaq Presario. This event changed my life forever. Their gift gave life to my passion for technology and the Internet.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy:
          <ul>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <li>A good game of checkers</li>
            <li>Swimming</li>
            <li>Trying new food</li>
          </ul>

        <p>I am currently enrolled as a Team Treehouse student working on completing the Front End Web Development Techdegree Program where I am learning:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>JQuery</li>
          <li>React</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are many exciting and gratifying careers out there to pursue, but to me, Web Development is the best of all! There's nothing like building a beautiful website using code and sharing it with the world! It’s also a joy to learn and grow with others while tackling complex challenges.</p>
        <p>I'd like to work for a company where I can use my skills to create positive online experiences between clients and customers.</p>
